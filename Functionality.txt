Provider:
	- Asked to enter their provider number to login to terminal

	- When a member enters visits a provider, provider enters member number into terminal,
	which then checks if the number if valid, if so it displays "Validated" otherwise it displays "Invalid Number" if the number is invalid or "Member suspended" if the member is suspended.

	- To record a service a member used the provider enters the members number then after the word "Validated" appears they enter the date the service was provided in the format MM-DD-YYYY.
	Then the provider uses the provider directory to look up the six-digit code corresponding to the service provided and keys in that code.
	The software then displays the name of the service corresponding to that code or an error so the provider knows if entered the correct code.
	The provider then verifies that the service is correct and enters any comments about the service they wish to.
	The following information is then recorded to disk
		- Current date and time MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS
		- Date service was provided MM-DD-YYYY
		- Provider number 9-digits
		- Member number 9-digits
		- Service code 6-digits
		- Comments 100 characters optional
	Then the software looks up the fee for that service and displays it on the provider terminal
